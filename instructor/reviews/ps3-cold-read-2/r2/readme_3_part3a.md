# Problem Set 3 (PS3): Feeding a cell-free protein factory

[README.md:B002 paragraph]
A cell-free protein synthesis system uses cellular machinery in a reaction
mixture to make a protein. That machinery needs amino acids, nucleotides, and
energy. The metabolic reactions in the mixture can make amino acids from other
available compounds, and amino acids can also be supplied directly.

[README.md:B003 paragraph]
You will use linear programming to find the maximum production rate of deGFP, a
green fluorescent protein, when the amino-acid supply rates share one total
budget. Two strategies divide that budget. With **equal allocation**, each amino
acid may use at most an equal share. With **optimized allocation**, the solver
decides how to divide the budget among the amino acids. You will plot the maximum
production rate against the budget for both strategies. Many supply vectors can
reach the same maximum, so you will then use flux variability analysis to find
the smallest and largest value each supply flux can take at that maximum.

[README.md:B004 paragraph]
This assignment extends the flux balance analysis in L6b. The supplied model is
adapted from the model described by **Vilkhovoy et al. (2018), “Sequence Specific
Modeling of E. coli Cell-Free Protein Synthesis,” ACS Synthetic Biology, 7(8),
1844–1857** ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29944340/),
[DOI: 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00465](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00465)).
The code and model data are available in the Varner laboratory's
[sequence-specific cell-free protein synthesis repository](https://github.com/varnerlab/Sequence-Specific-FBA-CFPS-Publication-Code).
The [data notes](data/README.md) identify the source and the PS3 operating conditions.

[README.md:B007 heading]
## Getting started

[README.md:B008 paragraph]
Use Julia `1.12.7`. The assignment contains its own data and source files.
Open the extracted assignment folder in VS Code. Run these commands from the
folder containing this README and [Project.toml](Project.toml):

[README.md:B009 code]
```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --startup-file=no --project=. check_submission.jl
```

[README.md:B010 paragraph]
The first command installs the required packages and can take several minutes.
The second runs the assignment tests. The four functions in
[src/Compute.jl](src/Compute.jl) initially raise errors because you must implement
them. Tests will fail until that work is complete.

[README.md:B011 paragraph]
Implement the four functions in `src/Compute.jl` and answer the five questions in
[responses.md](responses.md). You may add helper files in `src/`; if you do, load
them from [Include.jl](Include.jl). Keep all other supplied files unchanged.

[README.md:B012 heading]
## The model and its operating conditions

[README.md:B013 paragraph]
The model contains 146 species and 265 reactions. It includes metabolism,
transcription, translation, amino-acid supply, and protein output. The supplied
[load_model function](src/Model.jl) reads the stoichiometric matrix and sets the
operating conditions. Its returned named tuple contains:

[README.md:B014 table]
| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `S` | Stoichiometric matrix; rows are species and columns are reactions. |
| `reactions`, `metabolites` | Identifiers in matrix column and row order. |
| `lower`, `upper` | One lower and upper flux bound per reaction, in mM/h. |
| `amino_acids` | Names of the 20 supplied amino acids. |
| `amino_acid_uptake` | Column indices of their supply reactions. |
| `protein` | Column index of the deGFP output reaction. |
| `translation` | Column index of translation initiation. |
| `translation_limit` | Translation-capacity bound, in mM/h, already set as the `translation` column's upper bound. |

[README.md:B015 paragraph]
The `load_model` function already sets these operating conditions in `lower` and
`upper`. The glucose supply limit is **1 mM/h** and the oxygen supply limit is
**100 mM/h**. Amino-acid synthesis is enabled, while the reactions that degrade
amino acids or export them from the mixture are blocked. The transcription and
translation bounds are computed from fixed gene-expression parameters in the
supplied data. Use these conditions for both strategies; your functions change
only how the amino-acid supply is limited.

[README.md:B016 paragraph]
Supply reactions are written as `[] --> species` and have **nonnegative**
fluxes, so each amino-acid supply flux adds a nonnegative amount to the total that
the budget limits. The deGFP output reaction removes the protein that translation
makes, so its flux is the production rate. Every species, including deGFP,
satisfies a steady-state balance.

[README.md:B017 paragraph]
All model fluxes are in **mM/h**, millimoles per liter per hour. Report protein
production in **µM/h** by multiplying its model flux by 1000. The supply budget
is a rate limit; it does not specify an initial concentration or a monetary cost.
This static model predicts feasible production rates under fixed conditions.

[README.md:B018 heading]
## Part 1: Construct the objective and supply constraints

[README.md:B019 paragraph]
Let the vector $\mathbf{v}$ contain the reaction fluxes, and let $p$ be the
protein-output column, `model.protein`. The production problem is given by:

[README.md:B020 display]
$$
\begin{aligned}
\underset{\mathbf{v}}{\operatorname{maximize}}\quad & v_p\\
\text{subject to}\quad & \mathbf{S}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0},\\
& \boldsymbol{\ell}\leq\mathbf{v}\leq\mathbf{u},\\
& \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}\leq\mathbf{b}.
\end{aligned}
$$

[README.md:B021 paragraph]
The vectors $\boldsymbol{\ell}$ and $\mathbf{u}$ specify the flux bounds.
The matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\mathbf{b}$ hold any additional supply
inequality. Define $\mathcal{I}$ as the set of amino-acid supply columns,
`model.amino_acid_uptake`; let $K=|\mathcal{I}|$, and let $U\geq0$ be the total
supply budget in mM/h, the `budget` argument of your functions.

[README.md:B022 paragraph]
**Equal allocation.** Each amino acid may use at most one equal share of the
budget. Its upper bound is given by:

[README.md:B023 display]
$$
u_j^{\mathrm{equal}}=\min(u_j,U/K),\qquad j\in\mathcal{I}.
$$

[README.md:B024 paragraph]
The supply fluxes can be smaller than their limits. Any unused share remains
unavailable to the other amino acids. These individual limits already enforce
the total budget, so equal allocation adds no inequality: `A = zeros(0, n)`,
where `n` is the number of reactions, and `b = Float64[]`.

[README.md:B025 paragraph]
**Optimized allocation.** Retain the original individual bounds and add one
shared supply constraint, given by:

[README.md:B026 display]
$$
\sum_{j\in\mathcal{I}}v_j\leq U.
$$

[README.md:B027 paragraph]
The solver may distribute the available supply unequally. `A` is a single row,
a 1×n matrix, with a coefficient of one at each amino-acid supply column and zero
elsewhere, and `b = [U]`. Metabolic synthesis of amino acids remains
available under both strategies and does not count as external supply.

[README.md:B028 paragraph]
Implement two functions in [src/Compute.jl](src/Compute.jl):

[README.md:B029 list]
1. **protein_objective(model)** returns a `Vector{Float64}` with one coefficient
   per reaction. Its protein-output coefficient is one; the others are zero.
2. **allocation_constraints(model, budget; strategy=:equal)** returns a named tuple
   with fields `lower`, `upper`, `A`, and `b`. Support `:equal` and `:optimized`.
   Copy the bound arrays so that solving one scenario cannot change the next.
   Reject a negative or nonfinite budget or an unknown strategy with `ArgumentError`.

[README.md:B030 paragraph]
Use the model's supplied column indices. Your functions must also work on the
small test networks, which have different numbers and orders of reactions and
amino-acid supplies. All test models have nonnegative supply fluxes and at least
one supply column. Keep all lower bounds and unrelated upper bounds unchanged.

[README.md:B031 paragraph]
Run the Part 1 checks with:

[README.md:B032 code]
```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project=. testme_part_1.jl
```

[README.md:B033 paragraph]
For a hand check, consider two amino acids with supply fluxes $v_1$ and $v_2$.
One unit of protein output $v_p$ consumes two units of the first amino acid and
one unit of the second. The balances are $v_1=2v_p$ and $v_2=v_p$.
With a total supply budget of 6 and all other bounds loose, equal allocation
allows at most **1.5** units of protein output; optimized allocation allows
**2**. Explain these numbers to yourself before testing the larger network.

[README.md:B034 heading]
## Part 2: Compute and interpret the production curves

[README.md:B035 paragraph]
Implement **production_curve(model, budgets)** in
[src/Compute.jl](src/Compute.jl). For each budget, construct both sets of
constraints and solve both LPs. Use your Part 1 functions and the supplied
[solve_lp function](src/Solver.jl), which maximizes $\mathbf{c}^{\top}\mathbf{v}$
subject to the balances, bounds, and $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}\leq\mathbf{b}$. A single
solve has this form:

[README.md:B036 code]
```julia
limits = allocation_constraints(model, budget; strategy=:equal);
c = protein_objective(model);
result = solve_lp(model.S, limits.lower, limits.upper, c;
    A=limits.A, b=limits.b);
```

[README.md:B037 paragraph]
The result contains `status`, `optimal`, `flux`, and `objective`. Check
`result.optimal` before reading the fluxes. If a solve is not optimal, throw an
`ErrorException` naming the budget, strategy, and status. In that case the solver
returns `nothing` for `flux` and `objective`.

[README.md:B038 paragraph]
Return a vector containing one named tuple `(; budget, equal, optimized)` per
input budget. The budget remains in mM/h; both production rates must be in µM/h.
Preserve the input order, including repeated budgets. An empty input returns an
empty vector. Negative or nonfinite budgets raise `ArgumentError`.

[README.md:B039 paragraph]
After completing the function, run:

[README.md:B040 code]
```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project=. testme_part_2.jl
julia --startup-file=no --project=. runproduction.jl
```

[README.md:B041 paragraph]
The supplied driver, `runproduction.jl`, evaluates budgets from **0 to 4 mM/h in
steps of 0.1** and writes these files:

[README.md:B042 list]
- `outputs/production-versus-budget.png` and `.svg`: the two production curves
  and the translation capacity, converted to a protein production rate in µM/h.
  The terminal also prints this capacity.
- `outputs/production-versus-budget.csv`: the numerical values used in the plot.
- `outputs/amino-acid-allocation.csv`: actual supply fluxes for both strategies
  at a total budget of **1 mM/h**. The driver first checks that each solution
  satisfies the balances, bounds, and budget, then prints its production rate
  and total supply.

[README.md:B043 paragraph]
Until you complete `supply_ranges` in Part 3, the driver skips the Part 3 files
and says so. Open the plot and use it with the CSV tables to answer questions 1
and 2 in [responses.md](responses.md). The optimized allocation can have multiple equally
productive flux distributions. Tests check feasibility and production, so they
accept alternative optimal allocations. Part 3 measures how much those
distributions differ.

AUDIT THIS PART: README.md:B044 to README.md:B050

[README.md:B044 heading]
## Part 3: Which supply fluxes does the optimum determine?

[README.md:B045 paragraph]
The optimal production rate of a linear program is unique, but the flux vector
that achieves it often is not. L6a introduced **flux variability analysis (FVA)**,
which finds the smallest and largest value of each flux among all flux vectors
that reach the optimum. FVA was introduced by **Mahadevan and Schilling (2003),
“The effects of alternate optimal solutions in constraint-based genome-scale
metabolic models,” Metabolic Engineering, 5(4), 264–276**
([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14642354/),
[DOI: 10.1016/j.ymben.2003.09.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2003.09.002)).
Their method also allows flux vectors that reach only part of the optimum. PS3
sets that part with a fraction $\gamma$ between 0 and 1; $\gamma=1$ keeps only
optimal flux vectors.

[README.md:B046 paragraph]
Let $\mathbf{c}$ be the protein objective and $z^\star$ the maximum protein-output
flux, in mM/h, under one allocation strategy at budget $U$. For each supply column
$j\in\mathcal{I}$, the range endpoints are given by:

[README.md:B047 display]
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_j^{\min}=\min_{\mathbf{v}}\ v_j,\qquad v_j^{\max}=\max_{\mathbf{v}}\ v_j
\quad\text{subject to}\quad & \mathbf{S}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0},\quad
\boldsymbol{\ell}\leq\mathbf{v}\leq\mathbf{u},\quad \mathbf{A}\mathbf{v}\leq\mathbf{b},\\
& \mathbf{c}^{\top}\mathbf{v}\geq\gamma z^\star.
\end{aligned}
$$

[README.md:B048 paragraph]
The bounds, $\mathbf{A}$, and $\mathbf{b}$ are those that `allocation_constraints`
returns for the chosen strategy. With $\gamma=1$, the ranges cover only optimal
flux vectors; with $\gamma<1$, they also cover flux vectors that produce at least
the fraction $\gamma$ of the optimum.

[README.md:B049 paragraph]
PS3 applies FVA only to the amino-acid supply fluxes, 20 in the full model. Many
internal reactions are written as separate forward and reverse columns. Both
columns of such a pair can carry the same flux, which cancels in every balance,
so the pair's ranges mostly reflect its bounds rather than the optimum.

[README.md:B050 paragraph]
The driver and questions 3–5 call a supply flux **fixed** when
$v_j^{\max}-v_j^{\min}\leq10^{-5}$ mM/h: the optimum then determines its value.
This is a reporting rule only; the function below returns the range endpoints and
no fixed flag.
