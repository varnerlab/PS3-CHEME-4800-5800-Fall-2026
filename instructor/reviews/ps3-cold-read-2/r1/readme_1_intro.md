# Problem Set 3 (PS3): Feeding a cell-free protein factory

[README.md:B002 paragraph]
A cell-free protein synthesis system uses cellular machinery in a reaction
mixture to make a protein. That machinery needs amino acids, nucleotides, and
energy. The metabolic reactions in the mixture can make amino acids from other
available compounds, and amino acids can also be supplied directly.

[README.md:B003 paragraph]
You will use linear programming to predict the production rate of deGFP, a green
fluorescent protein, under two amino-acid supply strategies. With **equal
allocation**, every amino acid receives the same supply limit. With **optimized
allocation**, the solver distributes a shared supply budget among the amino acids.
You will plot protein production against the total supply budget. You will then
use flux variability analysis to find which supply fluxes the optimum determines
and which it leaves open.

[README.md:B004 paragraph]
This assignment extends the flux balance analysis in L6b. The supplied model is
adapted from the model described by **Vilkhovoy et al. (2018), “Sequence Specific
Modeling of E. coli Cell-Free Protein Synthesis,” ACS Synthetic Biology, 7(8),
1844–1857** ([paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29944340/),
[DOI: 10.1021/acssynbio.7b00465](https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.7b00465)).
The code and model data are available in the Varner laboratory's
[sequence-specific cell-free protein synthesis repository](https://github.com/varnerlab/Sequence-Specific-FBA-CFPS-Publication-Code).
The [data notes](data/README.md) identify the source and the PS3 operating conditions.

## Logistics

[README.md:B006 list]
- **Release:** Saturday, October 3, 2026. **Initial submission deadline:**
  **11:59 PM ET on Saturday, October 17, 2026**.
- **Submission:** Upload `CHEME-4800-5800-PS3-<your netid>.zip` to Canvas.
  Replace the complete placeholder with your NetID.
- **Infinite-revision policy:** Submit something by the initial deadline to
  participate. Eligible students may then revise and resubmit until the end of
  the semester; the highest score is retained. No initial submission means a
  score of `0` and no access to later revisions.
- **Reference solution:** Released after the initial deadline. You may consult
  it to understand mistakes and debug your work, but may not copy it. Copying
  the reference solution results in a score of `0`.
- **Group and AI policy:** Submit independent work. You may discuss ideas with
  classmates but may not share code or solutions directly. You may use Julia
  documentation, AI tools, and internet resources. You are responsible for
  understanding and explaining your implementation.
- **Grading:** Maximum `4` points; see [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

[README.md:B007 heading]
## Getting started

[README.md:B008 paragraph]
Use Julia `1.12.7`. The assignment contains its own data and source files.
Open the extracted assignment folder in VS Code. Run these commands from the
folder containing this README and [Project.toml](Project.toml):

[README.md:B009 code]
```bash
julia --startup-file=no --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
julia --startup-file=no --project=. check_submission.jl
```

[README.md:B010 paragraph]
The first command installs the required packages and can take several minutes.
The second runs the assignment tests. The four functions in
[src/Compute.jl](src/Compute.jl) initially raise errors because you must implement
them. Tests will fail until that work is complete.

[README.md:B011 paragraph]
Implement the functions; answer the prompts in [responses.md](responses.md).
Keep helper files in `src/`; edit [Include.jl](Include.jl) to load them.
Edit `src/Compute.jl`, `Include.jl`, and `responses.md` and add helpers.
Keep all other supplied files unchanged.

[README.md:B012 heading]
## The model and its operating conditions

[README.md:B013 paragraph]
The model contains 146 species and 265 reactions. It includes metabolism,
transcription, translation, amino-acid supply, and protein output. The supplied
[load_model function](src/Model.jl) reads the stoichiometric matrix and sets the
operating conditions. Its returned named tuple contains:

[README.md:B014 table]
| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `S` | Stoichiometric matrix; rows are species and columns are reactions. |
| `reactions`, `metabolites` | Identifiers in matrix column and row order. |
| `lower`, `upper` | One lower and upper flux bound per reaction, in mM/h. |
| `amino_acids` | Names of the 20 supplied amino acids. |
| `amino_acid_uptake` | Column indices of their supply reactions. |
| `protein` | Column index of the deGFP output reaction. |
| `translation` | Column index of translation initiation. |
| `translation_limit` | Fixed translation-capacity bound, in mM/h. |

[README.md:B015 paragraph]
The glucose supply limit is **1 mM/h** and the oxygen supply limit is
**100 mM/h**. Amino-acid synthesis is enabled; the model's designated
amino-acid degradation reactions and amino-acid removal reactions are blocked.
Transcription and translation bounds are calculated from fixed expression
parameters before solving. Use the supplied conditions for both strategies.

[README.md:B016 paragraph]
Supply reactions are written as `[] --> species` and have **nonnegative**
fluxes. Each amino-acid supply flux therefore contributes positively to the
budget. The deGFP output reaction removes protein from the balanced network and
records its production rate. Metabolic intermediates satisfy steady-state
balances while protein leaves through that output reaction.

[README.md:B017 paragraph]
All model fluxes are in **mM/h**, millimoles per liter per hour. Report protein
production in **µM/h** by multiplying its model flux by 1000. The supply budget
is a rate limit; it does not specify an initial concentration or a monetary cost.
This static model predicts feasible production rates under fixed conditions.
